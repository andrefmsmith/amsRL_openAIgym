# *Pong!* from pixels
<img src="PongWinning_slowdown.gif" width=400px>  

In [this notebook](https://github.com/andrefmsmith/amsRL_openAIgym/blob/master/Pong/CodeBlog_PongFromPixels_2.0.ipynb) we will train a deep neural network to learn *Pong!* from pixels using policy gradients, mini-batch training and Future Rewards. In the notebook I go over my implementation, summarizing the key concepts and background to this approach, in an effort to review and improve my understanding.  
A [checkpoint](https://github.com/andrefmsmith/amsRL_openAIgym/blob/master/Pong/pongReinforce_21032020.policy) for a winning agent (see gif ;-)) is included as well.
